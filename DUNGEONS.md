## Dungeon 01 - Lafton 1 - Outer Keep

Civilization. Your base of operations. Has an inn, shops, training for clerics and thieves, a vault, etc. You can pick up an NPC and a quest to fight thieves in the tavern. In one of the rooms you can fight some giant rats. Inspired by TSR 9034 Keep on the Borderlands.

## Dungeon 02 - Lafton 2 - Inner Keep

You can adventure in here once you figure out the password. Has an NPC you can pick up, some monsters you can fight in the basement, some loot if you search people's bedrooms, and training for fighters and mages. You can even meet Olaf near the top of the keep tower. Inspired by TSR 9034 Keep on the Borderlands.

## Dungeon 03 - Transfer

A dungeon to hold all the menu towns. There's like 10 of them.

## Dungeon 04 - Goblin 1

Accessed by leaving Lafton. Probably the first dungeon your party should visit. Has easy monsters such as goblins. Is divided into the main dungeon (goblin caves), and two smaller cave systems. Inspired by TSR 9034 Keep on the Borderlands. Is a bit of a grind since your magic users don't have fireball until right before the chapel battle. I did lots of quick combat. This dungeon has frequent random encounters. The treasure rooms are safe to rest in. For the boss battle in the chapel, 1) go to town and level up and ID all your items before the battle, and 2) use your magic user scroll of hold person that you got in Lafton 2 to hold the giants.

## Dungeon 05 - Hobgoblin Pass & Giant Pass

If you try to adventure between the west and the east via a northern route, you'll need to pass through either Hobgoblin Pass or Giant Pass.

In Giant Pass, you can usually rest safely on the trail and on the hill giant side, but not on the fire giant side. The fire giant side also has random encounters with salamanders (need +1 or better weapons to hit them) and with a fire elemental (need +2 or better weapons to hit them, and they do 3d8). Also, just walking will do fire damage every other step. There is treasure hidden in both giant strongholds.

Hobgoblins are quite weak, with only 6 hit points each, both for regular hobgoblins and their leaders. They're like big goblins that you can't sweep, and the leaders like to fire their bows. It shouldn't take long to clean out their base. It is usually safe to rest there.

## Dungeon 06 - Drow 1

Drow elves are immune to magic so are very tough. This is a very difficult dungeon and you may want to come back to it later. It is very very long, using the "walk off the map to the east and appear back in the west" trick several times. Connects to Drow 2 at the end. Inspired by TSR 9021 Vault of the Drow.

## Dungeon 07 - Drow 2

Connects to Drow 1, Drow 3, a secret entrance in Danger Forest, and also has a teleporter to Dolmen Moor. This is an underground elven forest that is the headquarters of the drow elves.

## Dungeon 08 - Fror's Place (Lower Level)

This is the lower level of Fror's Place.

## Dungeon 09 - Wasteland / Dragon Mountain

This small module involves climbing a rope to a cave that contains a dragon.

## Dungeon 10 - Bugbears

Bugbear caves.

## Dungeon 11 - Lizard Man Island (Island W)

Accessed from over by Porttown.

## Dungeon 12 - Danger Forest

A forest located in the east. You can quickly walk through it, or you can go explore it. Contains two buildings with humanoids you can clear out. Contains two secret back entrances to Drow 2. Is a pretty confusing place because the area map is turned off and there's dense forest everywhere. There's also a couple caves on the west side.

## Dungeon 13 - Eldman's Fortress

A three-story castle containing a bunch of undead. The boss is a lich residing on the lowest level. Careful: high-level undead drain levels.

## Dungeon 14 - Lafton 3 - Under Attack

Lafton's outer keep, but under attack. This can be a bit jarring if you're trying to go back to Lafton to rest and you randomly get this. The trigger condition is finishing the Snake Worshippers dungeon.

## Dungeon 15 - Ships (INCOMPLETE)

Looks like a ship being boarded type adventure. It has no events though, so this one was never finished.

## Dungeon 16 - Quest for the Golden Fleece

A Greek-themed adventure. The party visits a series of Greek islands looking for the Golden Fleece. The order of places visited looks like 1) arena, 2) ship, 3) ship boarding another ship, 4) Sagas Island (top left), 5) Isle of Dread (bottom left), 6) Temple of Gaea (top right), 7) Island of Statues (bottom right).

## Dungeon 17 - Snake Worshippers

Accessed from the town of Dion. A temple full of snake cultists and poisonous snakes. There is a tower to the south, and a confusing complex to the north with lots of secret doors and traps.

## Dungeon 18 - Eldamar

A friendly elven forest city, with a little bit of combat and adventure if you venture down the forest paths.

## Dungeon 19 - Manta Claus

A Santa Claus-themed adventure. Santa and his elves are being attacked by winter-themed monsters (yetis, frost giants, wolves, white dragons, etc.) in this snow-covered outdoor dungeon. There are some caves in the middle and to the south.

## Dungeon 20 - Colga Wharf (INCOMPLETE)

Intended to be a dockside town that is attacked by pirates, with multiple buildings on fire, and leading into sailing on some ships. This dungeon is incomplete. It may have been deleted during a hard drive failure and not included in the backup. Looking at some old notes, it looks like this was also a segue to a completely different design that my dad made called Pirate Isles, which was also lost in a hard drive failure.

## Dungeon 21 - Krell's Gate

Krell is a robber baron. You can pass through his outer keep for 5 PP. If you accept a quest to defeat him and break into his inner keep, you'll end up fighting a very high level fighter.

## Dungeon 22 - Porttown Dungeon (INCOMPLETE)

Is currently blank. It may have been lost in a hard drive failure. It is basically the dungeon from TSR 2001.

## Dungeon 23 - Random Dungeon 1

A dungeon where you can grind and level up your characters. Accessed from Lafton. The entire dungeon spans 3 modules and each module contains 8 sections each, for a total of 24 sections. The first section is extremely easy, then next one is slightly harder, the next one is slightly harder, etc.

## Dungeon 24 - Random Dungeon 2

A dungeon where you can grind and level up your characters. Accessed from Lafton. The entire dungeon spans 3 modules and each module contains 8 sections each, for a total of 24 sections. The first section is extremely easy, then next one is slightly harder, the next one is slightly harder, etc.

## Dungeon 26 - Drow 3

After you defeat the boss battle in the Drow 2 dungeon, you can keep going downstairs and end up in Drow 3. In this one, you can expect more drow, lots of tunnels, and demonic creatures as you get closer and closer to the hot center of the earth.

## Dungeon 27 - Dolmen Moor

A graveyard full of undead. A stairwell in the southeast will take you to Llywelyn's Tomb. Inspired by TSR 9109 The Bane of Llywelyn.

King Llywelyn's underground tomb. Inspired by TSR 9109 The Bane of Llywelyn.
