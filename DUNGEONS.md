If you try to adventure between the west and the east via a northern route, you'll need to pass through either Hobgoblin Pass or Giant Pass.

## Dungeon 06 - Drow 1

Drow elves are immune to magic so are very tough. This is a very difficult dungeon and you may want to come back to it later. It is very very long, using the "walk off the map to the east and appear back in the west" trick several times. Connects to Drow 2 at the end. Inspired by TSR 9021 Vault of the Drow.

## Dungeon 07 - Drow 2

Connects to Drow 1, Drow 3, a secret entrance in Danger Forest, and also has a teleporter to Dolmen Moor. This is an underground elven forest that is the headquarters of the drow elves.

## Dungeon 12 - Danger forest

A forest located in the east. You can quickly walk through it, or you can go explore it. Contains two buildings with humanoids you can clear out. Contains two secret back entrances to Drow 2. Is a pretty confusing place because the area map is turned off and there's dense forest everywhere. There's also a couple caves on the west side.

A three-story castle containing a bunch of undead. The boss is a lich residing on the lowest level. Careful: high-level undead drain levels.
