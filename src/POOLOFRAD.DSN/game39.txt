DESCRIPTION: This is the thirty-third in a series of designs, a conversion of the classic game that started it all, Pool of Radiance.  I think a lot of us bought FRUA and immediately set about converting our favorite game to that system in hopes of playing Rangers and Paladins, and wielding the greatest spells of the game against The Boss.  Now, more than ten years later, it is finally done.  There have been a lot of false starts along the way (Ahem, "Eldritch Adventures"), but now it's done.  One of the greatest benefits of the online FRUA community is its comaraderie and plethora of talent.  Both provided the ability and reason to persevere into completing this conversion.  In a sense, it's the opus of the Realm.  It all comes to this adventure, even though there are a half dozen designs still remaining.  This is the conversion that intimidated me from the beginning, and now I can say that it's not only possible...It's FUN!  

As always, Before you play this design, you should download and play Game 00, Introduction.  This provides instructions on getting a Realm party started.  This game is suggested for play for any group, and can be considered an optional starting point for beginning-level characters. Also, players are encouraged to mix and match adventures to play those that most interest them as individuals.

Other UA authors MAY use the artwork and hacks in this
module.

I cannot imagine being restrictive about this stuff, after all so much
of what I could do was because of the work of others.  Aside from the 
characters and a slim margin of the scanned artwork, all I did was put
together the efforts of others into a remake of a classic adventure!
