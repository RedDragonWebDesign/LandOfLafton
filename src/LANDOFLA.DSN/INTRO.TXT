Land of Lafton

Lafton is a small keep located in the middle of a troubled continent.  
Civilization is being stressed by the forces of evil.  Key mountian passes
are blocked by monsters, or worse yet, greedy and powerful humans.  Beneath 
it all lies a powerful source of evil.

This Unlimited Adventures design is the electronic version of my world.  
My original world was started back in 1978 and I've been adding to it slowly 
ever since.  I and others played in this world off and on from 1978 through 1994.
Beginning this year, I transformed portions of it into Unlimited Adventures.
My seven year old son and I have been playing and testing it ever since.

You can start out at 4th level and work yourself up.  Explore Lafton, and then
start traveling arround.  If an area seems too hard, reduce the difficulty to 
Novice.  If that still doesn't work, give up on that area and go elsewhere to 
get more experience, then come back later when you are stronger.

I hope you have fun.
