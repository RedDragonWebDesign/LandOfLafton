AUTHOR'S NOTES

GENERAL NOTES AND ERRATA
This Supplement is meant as an addition to the documentation which
comes with Unlimited Adventures, not a replacement for it.  Many basic
features, as well as tutorials, are included in the original
Designer's Guide and are not discussed here.

There are several pre-drawn dungeon maps included in the Heirs to
Skull Crag adventure.  Look at the end of the module list for
additional maps not used in the adventure.  These modules all have
names beginning with an asterisk (*).

On the IBM version, display access will not always display correctly.

Some sprites and pictures are permanently associated with a monster,
and share that monster's name.  Such images can only be renamed in the
monster editor, not in the art gallery.  The sprite "BLACK PUDDING"
cannot be renamed in the second tutorial of the chapter entitled
"Customizing Art".  Simply press LEAVE and select "PICTURES", the try
renaming a picture such as "BIT O' MOANDER".

Throughout this supplement, references are made to which artwork can
be chosen for various options.  In all cases, COMBAT ICONS are not
available for these choices.  Combat icons only appear during actual
combat, and cannot be displayed at any other time.

NOTATION
All text which appears in UA is shown in capital letters.  Buttons
which lead to choices are surrounded by square brackets.  For short
lists of options or ranges of values, all options are shown within the
same square brackets.  Different choices are separated by slashes. 
Examples:

STARTING EQUIPMENT [AVERAGE]
DISTANCE [UP CLOSE/NEARBY/FAR AWAY]

Options with an On/Off button are designated with asterisks. Example:

* DO EVENT ONLY ONCE
* EXECUTE EVENT AT DESTINATION

Where a numerical range is possible, the range is given between square
brackets. Example:

HEIGHT/WIDTH [11 TO 50]


CREATE NEW DESIGN (GAME SETTINGS)

The Create New Design and Game Settings options are virtually
identical.  All options within are the same.  The main difference is
that the first option will let you create a brand new design, while
the second only lets you edit the primary characteristics of an
existing design.

PAGE 1
ADVENTURE DESIGN NAME
Type the full name as the PLAYER will see it. If you are creating a
new design (as opposed to just editing Game Settings), UA will
automatically make a directory name which fits (if a similar name
exists, it alters enough letters to make it unique).

THE ADVENTURE BEGINS IN [Dungeon 01] AT ENTRY POINT [1 to 8].
Select one of 36 dungeons or 4 overland areas in which to start. A
starting entry point (as opposed to a coordinate location) must be
designated.

EACH PARTY MEMBER STARTS WITH
[0 to 30 million] EXPERIENCE POINTS
STARTING EQUIPMENT [none to +4]
PLATINUM [0 to 5000]
Gems [0 to 5000]
Jewelry [0 to 5000]

Experience points determine the starting level of each new character
(multi-class characters have their experience divided by the number of
classes before figuring out the starting level). Platinum, Gems, and
Jewelry determine starting wealth. The equipment that a party starts
with is determined by the option selected.  The possible options for
Starting Equipment are None, Poor, Modest, Average, Prosperous, and +1
through +4.  Note that no magic items at ALL are given (even to magic
users/clerics) until the +1 Equipment level.  For a complete list of
the items each character class receives at each setting, see Appendix
A.
Protection Password
This will cause your adventure to become LOCKED.  Once this is done,
the only way someone (including you) can modify (select any of the
right hand buttons) the game is by entering the same password. For
convenience, a designer should avoid using this feature until the
adventure is completed.

PAGE 2
Keys in Special Inventory
These are item names for special keys used to in getting through
various locked doors (or opening special chests, etc.) in the game.
They never actually exist as items in a character's ITEM inventory,
but are listed in the party inventory (shown by selecting INV at the
main menu in the game). They don't even necessarily have to be called
"keys" - that's just a convenient reference.

PAGE 3
Other Special Inventory Items
Similar to the keys above, but in a more generic manner. These are
"Quest" items which can be checked for in various EVENTS. As with the
keys, the actual names are up to you (samples are shown as defaults).


ART GALLERY

Unlimited Adventures comes with a substantial library of artwork,
including some animation, for use in adventures.  To enhance this
aspect of the game and allow designers to truly customize their
adventures, new artwork can be imported to replaced unused pictures. 
UA specifically supports art drawn in Electronic Arts' DeluxePaint IIª
and ZSoft's PC Paintbrushª.  Artwork from other programs may work as
well.

DRAWING ART FOR IMPORT
On the IBM-PC, all art must be drawn in 256 color mode.  Many programs
default to a 16 color mode.  Make sure your paint program is in a 256
color mode.

Palette cycling can only be specified in DeluxePaint II.  All color
cycles you set up in the paint program will be used.  Cycling only
works on PICs and BIGPICs.

To be able to import color art on the Macintosh version, you must set
the amount of memory for the program to 2000.  Use the Get Info
command in the Finder to set this number.  Macintosh color art can be
drawn in any program that will save a picture as a PICT file.  For
PICs and CPICs, any color close to the transparent color in shade will
become transparent.  Macintosh Mono art can be drawn in any program
that will save as a MacPaint file.

Imported art will not transfer correctly between the IBM-PC version
and the Mac version.  The remainder of a design and all saved
characters and games are transferable.

There are nine types of art which can appear in UA.  Each has a
predetermined number of slots in the Art Gallery.  Most of the images
can be replaced by Importing, but the total number of slots can never
be changed.

PICTURE (155 slots) - Usually shown as NPC pictures, Towns, Towers,
and similar small graphic images.

SPRITE (38 slots) - These are usually a collection of three monster
images.  When displayed in the game (especially in an encounter with
Auto Approach turned on), the monsters appear to be charging the
party.

COMBAT ICON (127 slots) - These icons appear during combat sequences
and represent monsters and NPCs.  There are always two icons in a set
- the monster at "Ready" and the monster taking "Action."

BIG PICTURE (8 slots) - The showpieces of the Art Gallery, these
images take up the upper half of the screen.

OVERLAND MAP (5 slots) - All travel outside of dungeons takes place on
one of these maps, which also takes up the top half of the screen.

DUNGEON (5 slots) - These are the wall styles shown in non-outdoor
combat.

WILDERNESS (4 slots) - These styles determine the combat surroundings
in outdoor combat.

WALL SET (16 slots) - Each wall set contains up to 5 images for use in
dungeon modules.  Up to three wall sets can be used in any single
module.

BACKDROP (19 slots) - Backdrops are used in dungeon modules as the
floor and "ceiling" against the wall sets in the 3-D view.

Note that the Dungeon, Wilderness, Wall Set, and Backdrop graphics
cannot be changed.  The Import option is removed when viewing these
pictures.


ART TEMPLATES
UA includes several templates, in both PCX and LBM format, for use in
importing artwork.  The templates, or copies of them, must be used for
the new artwork -- UA uses portions of the templates to determine the
size and shape of the imported art.  Note that the PCX template for
COMBAT ICONs which come with version 1.0 is bad.  The LBM template can
be converted using any program which performs a LBM->PCX conversion. 
Additionally, a correct PCX template can be downloaded from the
Unlimited Adventures area on America Online (keyword: UA).

The templates included are (in both LBM and PCX format -- see note
above):
DRAWBPIC - For Big Picture artwork
DRAWCPIC - For Combat Icon artwork
DRAWPIC - For Picture artwork
DRAWSPRITE - For Sprite artwork

Two sample templates, TOWN.LBM and TOWN.PCX, are also included for use
in the Designer's Guide tutorial.

MONSTER EDITOR

As mentioned in the Designers book, there are exactly 127 available
slots for Monsters and ALL slots are currently filled. To create a new
monster or NPC, you will need to edit an existing slot.  Those wishing
to share their monster designs can find altered monsters in the
appropriate DSN directory labeled MONST###.DAT. While you cannot
directly (from DOS) copy monsters from one design to another (you can
- but it doesn't change the monster name within the design), you could
put together an "adventure" which exists purely as a holder for edited
monsters (no Module designs) and upload a zipped version of that
directory for other designers to copy.

COPY
Prompts you to select another design. Once there, you get a list of
all monsters in that design.  When you COPY a monster, it copies over
ALL the data for that monster EXCEPT for the battle icon (and any
other images associated - see ART GALLERY for a discussion on changing
images), including the name. As with edited or renamed monsters,
selecting DEFAULT returns it to the normal state.

RENAME
Renames the highlighted monster.

EDIT
There are three types of monsters you can edit. Regular (most of
them), "Complex" (called "big" monsters in the Designer's Guide -
those with a "*" to the left of their name), and NPCs (which have a #
in their name). Regular and Complex monsters will be discussed
together, since there are few differences. NPCs will be discussed
separately.

EDITING REGULAR AND COMPLEX MONSTERS
PAGE 1
Name
Acts just like the RENAME command to change the name of the selected
monster.

RACE
Either a player race or "monster." The race has little effect on the
functioning of a monster, as the racial characteristics of the player
races are embodied in various monster effects and monsters are not
subject to race/class level limitations.  Note that monsters of race
"monster" are not vulnerable to "Hold Person" and "Charm Person"
spells.

GENDER
Male or Female. No functional effect. (There are no spells or effects
which affect only one gender or the other.)

ALIGNMENT
One of the 9 game alignments. This will not affect whether a monster
is an ENEMY or not, but gives immunity or vulnerability to certain
spells and effects in the game. (Protection vs. Good/Evil, etc.)

CLASS
One of 15 selections. This primarily affects the monster's saving
throw tables and some other resistances, as appropriate. (It is NOT
used to calculate THAC0; that must be manually set later.) The player
is unaware of what the class is, so impossible combinations in AD&D
(e.g., Gnome Paladin) are possible here. Note: monsters of class MAGE
will not move during combat.

HIT POINTS [1 to 255]

AGE [1 to 1200]
The only material effect of age is that "haste" spells or Potions of
Speed may cause monsters to die of old age.

MAGIC RESISTANCE [0 to 100]
Number indicates percent.  Magic Resistance is determined BEFORE
saving throws. If a monster makes its Magic Resistance roll, it
suffers no effects at ALL from a specific spell. If it fails, then
regular saving throws are applied.  Magic Resistance is specified for
spells cast by an 11th level character; each level the caster is
higher or lower than 11th modifies the magic resistance by 5%.

LEVEL [0 to 40]
Non-editable. This is the highest class level from Page 2. Included
here for reference only.

Stats
All stats range from 3-30 (18 is the normal human maximum). The
percentage (0 to 100) behind the Strength statistic only applies if
the strength is exactly 18. Stats higher than 18 can produce enhanced
effects (more spells, lower AC, etc.) based on the stat so raised.

PAGE 2
LEVEL [0 to 40]
This affects things like the number and type of spells possible to
memorize.  Note that you can put visual contradictions here. For
example, you may have a monster defined as a "Thief" on the previous
page, but give it some level of ability as a Mage and/or Cleric which
gives it some spell-casting ability (perhaps for a new race of
creatures which are not literally mages, but can all cast Shocking
Grasp several times a day).

Misc Options
The party gets [0 to 65000] experience when monster is killed.
This is PER creature involved, so be sure to avoid unbalancing the
game this way.

UNDEAD TYPE [NOT UNDEAD through SPECIAL]
This does not change the monster's literal abilities, but anything
except "Not Undead" may allow a Cleric or Paladin to TURN the monster,
causing it to flee or be destroyed. ("Special" undead are a class
almost impossible to TURN, even under normal circumstances.)

PAGE 3
ATTRIBUTE OPTIONS
Multiple, even contradictory (e.g., Mammal and Snake) options may be
selected.

Form
* MAMMAL
Indicates whether the monster is vulnerable to the second level Druid
Spell "Charm Person or Mammal."

* ANIMAL
Determines whether the monster is susceptible to the first level Druid
spell "Invisibility to Animals."

* SNAKE
Determines whether the monster is vulnerable to the second level
Clerical spell "Snake Charm."

* TRUE GIANT
Indicates whether the monster takes extra damage from a Long Sword vs
Giants.

* LARGE EVEN IF ICON 1 BY 1
Monster receives weapon damage based on the "Large" column on the
damage table.  All monsters with wide, tall, or big icons are
automatically considered larger than man-sized.

Penalties

* DWARF AC
Indicates that creatures with the effect "Dwarf AC bonus" (e.g.
dwarves) get an AC bonus of +4 when attacked by the monster.

* GNOME AC
Indicates that creatures with the effect "Gnome AC bonus" (e.g.
gnomes) get an AC bonus of +4 when attacked by the monster.

* DWARF THAC0
Indicates that creatures with the effect "Dwarf THAC0 +1" (e.g.
dwarves) get a THAC0 bonus of +1 when attacking the monster.

* GNOME THAC0
Indicates that creatures with the effect "Gnome THAC0 +1" (e.g.
gnomes) get a THAC0 bonus of +1 when attacking the monster.

* RANGER DAMAGE
Indicates that creatures with the effect "Ranger Gnt Bonus" (e.g.
rangers) get a damage bonus equal to their ranger levels whenever they
hit the monster.

IMMUNE TO

* POISON
Indicates that the monster is immune to poison, including "stinking
cloud".

* DEATH
Indicates that the monster is immune to all death magic, including
"Cloudkill."

* CONFUSION
Indicates that confusion wands, spells, and gazes have no effect on
the monster.

* VORPAL SWORDS
Indicates that the monster cannot be decapitated by a vorpal blade.

MISC OPTIONS

* MAY BE HELD OR CHARMED
Indicates that the monster is vulnerable to charm or hold spells. 
Note that the monster is also invulnerable to "Hold Person" spells if
it is of race "monster"; only humans and similar races are susceptible
to "Hold Person."

* AFFECTED BY DISPEL EVIL
Indicates that the monster is summoned from another plane of existence
and may be affected by the fifth level clerical spell "Dispel Evil".

PAGE 4
MONSTER ATTACKS
ATTACK TYPE 1
[0 to 50] BLOWS EVERY 2 ROUNDS
OF [0 to 50] [1 to 99] SIDED DICE + [0 to 99]
For example, "5 10 sided dice + 6" will cause a damage computation as
if a 10-sided die was rolled five times, summed up, and then 6 points
added to the final total. Note that this allows for a maximum damage
PER ATTACK of 5049 points of damage! Use with care - remember the
maximum player HP is also 255.

An odd number of blows causes a blow to be skipped (or added) every
second round. E.g., 3 Blows per 2 rounds causes 1 blow the first
round, 2 the second, 1 the third, etc.

ATTACK TYPE 2
This is structured just like Attack Type 1.  This is meant to be the
monster's secondary attack.  For example, a lion might have Attack
Type 1 set as 4 blows per 2 rounds (indicating 2 claw attacks each
single round) and Attack Type 2 set as 2 blows per 2 rounds
(indicating one bite attack each round).

MORE COMBAT OPTIONS
BASE THAC0 [-50 to 50] PLUS STR BONUS
This is the minimum die roll needed to hit a target with Armor Class
0. The lower the better. Modifications are made for each attack based
on Strength, and numerous combat circumstances (hit from behind, Held,
actual AC, etc.) to decide the final chance to hit.

BASE AC [-20 to 20] PLUS DEX BONUS
The lower the AC, the harder this monster will be to hit. "10" is the
normal "worst" armor class - comparable to a human wearing street
clothes (no protection at all).


BASE MOVEMENT [0 to 60 (0 to 12 in v1.0)]
Zero makes a monster stationary. It will not be able to move at all in
combat.

PAGE 5
THE MONSTER HAS
PLATINUM [0 to 65000]
GEMS [0 to 65000]
JEWELRY [0 to 65000]

ITEM/REG Note - COMPLEX monsters have 6 total slots of each, compared
to only 3 slots of each for regular monsters.

ITEM
These are the items which each monster will have available to it for
combat. Selections of armor, weapons, and usable miscellaneous magic
items (Dart of Hornets Nest, wands, etc.) will be used appropriately
in combat (a +2 Sword will be used for attacks, armor will lower AC).
It is possible to give a monster an extra item (e.g., a second sword,
or a potion) in one of these slots to give a standard "treasure" bonus
for this monster class (avoiding the need for a COMBAT TREASURE
event).

REG
For most items, this has no effect.  For items with charges (e.g.,
wands) or a quantity (e.g., arrows) associated with them this button
can alter the default amount. "REG" (Regular) means to use the default
amount (so 10 Arrows will really be 10 arrows). Selecting a number
forces the quantity or charges to that amount. All wands have 20
charges as a default value.

PAGE 6
EFFECT
Complex monsters can have up to 10 effects. Regular monsters only get
5.  Individual effects areas are discussed broadly below.  An itemized
list of each type of effect can be found in Appendix B.

SPELLS
Affects monster exactly as if the named Clerical or Mage spell had
been cast immediately before combat started.  However, these effects
do not wear off over time and cannot be dispelled with "Dispel Magic."

ITEMS
These effects are automatically placed when the generating items are
readied by a character; use the effects only when they are inherent in
a monster (such as "Cloak Displace" for a displacer beast).

PLAY CHARS
These effects are attributes of various player character races and
classes.  They must be explicitly given to monsters of those races or
classes.

DEFENSE BONUSES
The effects can make monsters more difficult, or even impossible, to
attack by various means, as well as adding other protective
capabilities.

ATTACKS
Some attacks are contingent upon attack #1 hitting or attack #2
hitting.  Other attacks are conducted independently of normal melee
attacks.

HAZARDS
These effects introduce special vulnerabilities to the monsters.


MEMORIZED [0 to 140]
The number of spells currently memorized by this monster.  The monster
must be at least Level 1 in Magic-User (for Mage spells), Cleric (for
Cleric Spells), Paladin (for Cleric Spells), and/or Ranger (for Mage
and Druid spells) to receive certain spells. Class level does NOT
affect the number of spells or spell-levels permitted to be memorized.
(E.g, a 1st-level mage can learn 9th-level spells, for example).
However, be aware that most spells have durations, ranges, and effects
based on the ACTUAL level of the spell-caster - so low-level mages
casting high-level spells are either wasting their time (a 1 die
"Fireball" is good for toasting marshmallows, and not much else) or
endangering their lives (a 1st level mage cannot cast "Cloudkill" far
enough away to exclude his breathing space).


EDITING NPCS
If you select to edit an NPC (a monster with a "#" in front of its
name), you are immediately asked:
RE-CREATE NPC?  [YES/NO]

Selecting NO (i.e., edit the CURRENT NPC - do not create a new one)
takes you through the following two pages:

PAGE 1
The ONLY thing a designer can change on this page is the name of the
NPC (the only light-grey field). Other fields on this page are
identical to those of regular monsters, although they are not editable
at this time (only when creating a new NPC).

PAGE 2
PLATINUM, GEMS, and JEWELRY are editable as with regular monsters.

ITEMS are also treated the same way except that an NPC can start with
up to 8 total items (compared to 3 for a regular monster and 6 for a
complex monster).

SPELLS MEMORIZED [0 to 140]
This option works the same way as spells for regular monsters.

Selecting YES on the Edit Monster screen indicates that you wish to
create an entirely new NPC.  (Note that a bug in version 1.0 creates
NPCs with a very low morale.  The effect of this bug is that NPCs will
almost always immediately flee or surrender in combat unless
controlled by a high-level player character.)  You are now asked a
number of questions:

EXPERIENCE[0 to 99999999]
This will determine the NPC's level (if multiclass, experience is
divided by the number of classes before levels are determined). Press
ENTER when ready.

PICK RACE/ALIGNMENT/GENDER/CLASS
Same restrictions as if you were creating a regular character.  Select
DONE when finished on this screen.

REROLL STATS
Determines the NPC's statistics.  MODIFY is permitted here (didn't
work in 1.0).  Select DONE when you are satisfied with the NPC's stats
or EXIT to stop creating a new PC (goes to Page 1 of the "Edit Current
NPC" series of pages).

CHARACTER NAME
15 characters permitted, just like regular characters.  The name must
start with a letter, but numbers can be used elsewhere in it.

TRY TO CHANGE CLASS
This option only appears if NPC is a Human.  This, if successful, will
create a Dual-Classed NPC.  Normal Dual-Class restrictions apply.
PICK NEW CLASS
Only appears if NPC is Human, YES is chosen for the previous question,
and the NPC meets AD&D's dual-classed human requirements with his or
her statistics.  A list of eligible classes will appear.

EXPERIENCE [0 to 99999999]
If a new class is selected above, the experience earned in that second
class is required. Note that a dual-classed human does not regain the
abilities of the original class unless he or she surpasses the old
class level in the new class, so be sure to assign the original class
experience low enough that the NPC will be at least one level higher
in the new class.

PAGES 1 and 2 follow, and are identical in function and appearance to
the pages which appear if you are only editing an existing NPC.


EDIT MODULES

The options described below are all covered in varying degrees of
detail in the original Designer's Guide.  Extra detail has been added
where it seems useful.

FILE MENU

OPEN
Opens a new module (overland or dungeon). If you have not saved your
current module, you will be prompted to:
SAVE (and open the new module)
DON'T SAVE (and open the new module anyway)
CANCEL (return to the current module).

SAVE
Saves all changes in the current module to disk, and returns to the
edit screen.

WRITE TO
Save the data from this module under one of the other module names
(effectively duplicating the module).

COPY FROM
Copy data from another module into the current module (effectively
duplicating the other module).

REVERT TO SAVED
Ignore all changes and reload this module from disk.

GLOBAL INFO
Information changed in here applies to all locations in the current
module.

PAGE 1

ADVENTURE MODULE NAME
For the designer's purpose only. Players do not see this name.

HEIGHT/WIDTH [11 to 50]
(Dungeon modules only) The total area (Height times Width) must be 576
or less.

* ALLOW AREA VIEW?
(Dungeon modules only) Selecting this option will allow players to see
a basic overhead map of the module they are currently traversing.

SUMMONED MONSTER [goblin]
Determines which monster appears to fight for the party if a mage
casts the 9th level spell "Monster Summoning."

ZONE NAMES [zone 1 through zone 8]
Again, only for the designer's viewing. See the Designer's Guide for
the use of Zones.  Naming them here permits the designer to be able to
better discern different needs and areas within the modules.

PAGE 2
(The next two options exist for OVERLAND modules only.)

PICK MAP ART
Choose one of the five maps available.  (Note that you can import new
maps.  See ART GALLERY section for a discussion on importing graphics.
Importing a new map will replace one of the current maps.)

PICK OUTDOOR COMBAT ART FOR EACH ZONE
One function of Zoning is to allow combat graphics to be altered
universally. These selections will choose what art is used during
combat for locations marked as "Outside."


(The next three options are for DUNGEON modules only.)

PICK WALL ART SETS
Selects up to three wall sets (maximum 15 different walls) .  These
are the pictures seen in the 3-D view by the players.

PICK FLOOR AND CEILING ART
Select up to four different backdrops.  These are seen in the 3-D view
against the wall art selected above.

PICK COMBAT ART (Indoor/Outdoor)
This selects the combat background used (based on whether the current
zone is Indoors or Outdoors).

PAGES 3 through 6

ZONE MESSAGES 1 through 8
These are the messages a player will get when attempting to cross into
either of these zones from any other zone in the module.  (A blank
text field indicates no indication is given that the player has
changed zones.)

PAGE 7

DEFINE STEP EVENTS 1-3
A total of 8 different step events can be defined each module.  A step
event is, literally, an event which takes place each time the player
has taken a specified number of STEPS in that particular zone. Steps
are cumulative - if you take 8 steps in Zone 1 and leave for Zone 2,
when you return to Zone 1 you continue with step 9.  Definition of
each step event is the same - you can choose up to 8 different zones
(and combination) in which that event will occur.  You then choose the
number of steps until the event is triggered (range - 1 to 50000). 
You then choose the event type (discussed later).  Note that even
though only 8 Step Events themselves can be defined, by chaining
events you can produce far more than 8 ACTUAL events related to player
steps.

PAGE 8

DEFINE STEP EVENTS 4-6
As above.

PAGE 9

DEFINE STEP EVENTS 7-8
As above.

MORE MAP OPTIONS

UNDEAD ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO TURN BY [0 to 250]
The higher the number, the more difficult clerics will find it to turn
undead in this module (above 20 is practically impossible for any
level cleric).

CAMP PICTURE [camp 2]
This is the picture shown when the party has ENCAMPED.  You can
actually choose nearly any artwork (except the large pictures),
although there are three CAMP pictures specifically available.

TREASURE PICTURE [treasure 3]
As Camp Picture, but this artwork is shown after a successful combat
encounter when treasure is available.  Two standard Treasure pictures
are available.

PAGES 10 and 11

DEFINE REST EVENTS FOR ZONES 1-8
For each zone, a different event can be defined to occur if the party
attempts to rest.  The options are:
IN ZONE 1 A [choose event] EVENT HAS A [0 to 100] % CHANCE OF
OCCURRING EVERY [1 to 250] MINUTES.
Note that a bug exists in IBM version 1.0 which causes the event to
occur 100% of the time after the first time period expires.  For
example, if the event is set to happen 50% of the time every 100
minutes, then the first 100 minutes a party rests the event actually
only has a 50% chance of happening.  However, on the 101st minute of
the rest period, the chance of the event happening becomes 100%.

* CAN'T REST
Select this to refuse the party any chance of resting in this zone. 
(The REST and FIX options are removed from the ENCAMP menu.)

PRINT
Prints out an ASCII map of the module and text from all events in that
module.  Note that on the IBM version 1.0, only line feeds are sent to
the printer.  Most printers handle this with no problem.  Others may
need to be set to automatically include a Carriage Return (CR) with
each line feed (LF).  This problem is fixed in v1.1.

LEAVE
Stop editing modules.  If you have not saved your module, you will be
prompted to do so before exiting to the main screen.

MAP MENU

3-D VIEW
This option is not available when editing Overland modules.  In
Dungeon modules, selecting this will switch the screen to a 3-D view
on the left with a small overhead view on the right.

AREA VIEW
The only viewing option for Overland modules.  This shows an overhead
perspective (up to 21 blocks wide by 21 blocks high) of the current
map (whether Overland or Dungeon).

BLOCK PLACEMENT/WALL PLACEMENT
Select this function for placing blocks (impassable areas) on an
overland map.  For Dungeon modules, select this function to place one
of up to 15 wall pictures. Note that in 3-D mode, placing a Wall only
places it from the side you on -- in the "inside" of the location, so
speak -- so that looking into that location from the other side of
that wall placement will show nothing.  However, placing walls in Area
mode puts the wall art on both sides of the same location, so that it
is visible no matter from which direction the party arrives.

BACKDROP PLACEMENT
Lets you select any of the four backdrops for the locations you
specify.  When players step into these areas, the appropriate backdrop
will display above and below the selected walls.

ZONE PLACEMENT
This lets you define different zone areas within the dungeon.  Zones
help segment the dungeon into sections so that you can easily modify
Step and Rest events across a whole area without the need to edit each
location.  All locations of a single zone do not need to be connected. 
For example, Zone 8 could be internally called "SAFE REST ZONE" with a
Rest Event defined for Zone 8 areas as No Event.  Single locations of
Zone 8 could be scattered throughout the dungeon (in closets and other
out of the way places) to signify quiet and safe places for the party
to heal and rememorize spells.

EVENT PLACEMENT
Allows the placement of events and event chains throughout the module. 
Individual Events are described at the end of this document.

MOVE THROUGH WALLS
Only valid in 3-D mode.  When this selection is active (checked), the
designer can move the mark (yellow arrow) around without consideration
of the Obstruction status of any location.  This does not affect
actual game play.

UTILITIES MENU

DISPLAY ACCESS
Dungeon modules only.  Selecting this shows where a player can travel
from the current MARK.  Access is color-coded by type (freely
accessible, locked - key needed, etc.).  Because a recursive,
memory-constrained algorithm is used to to calculate accessible areas,
the IBM version may not correctly show access in very large open areas
or very long corridors.

REPLACE GLOBALLY
Dungeon modules only.  This function permits wholesale replacing of
entire wall pictures, backdrops, and zones with a different selection. 
It is not UNDOable.  You cannot globally replace events.  Select the
the new art or zone BEFORE choosing "REPLACE GLOBALLY."  After
selecting the new art and then activating Global replacement, choose
the art or zone to replace.

CLEAR MODULE

[CLEAR AND RESIZE THE ENTIRE MAP]
This erases everything from the module and sizes it to the
specifications entered below.

[CLEAR EVENTS ONLY]
Leaves all sections of the map untouched, but removes all events
defined for the module.

NEW HEIGHT/WIDTH [0 to 49]
Same effect as the Global Info.  Only has an effect if the first
option is chosen above.

ENTRY POINTS
Up to 8 entry points can be defined.  These entry points theoretically
permit shortcuts to be taken with teleports, stairs, and transfer
module events.  However, with IBM version 1.0 only the TRANSFER MODULE
event actually uses entry points correctly.  Select a map location,
then select an entry point from the list which appears.  Entry points
can only exist in one location at a time, although multiple entry
points can share the same location (although only the lowest-numbered
entry point is shown on screen).

PLACE ENTRY POINT
This places an entry point (from a vertical list) at the MARK's
current location and facing.  This function is identical to the Entry
Points option above,  but can be selected in any placement mode.

TEST MODULE
Loads a party from the SAVE directory into the module AT THE CURRENT
LOCATION AND FACING OF THE MARK. Note that the manual implies that
Test Module uses Entry Points to determine where the party is placed. 
However, this is not the case.  To test the module, place the Mark
exactly where you wish your test party to be located and then select
Utilities|Test Module.  You cannot test the destination portion of a
TRANSFER MODULE event, as you cannot leave the module you are
currently testing; attempting to do so will simply end the test.


EVENTS

There are 35 different types of events in Unlimited Adventures.  With
creative chaining of events and different definitions, an infinite
number of event actions can be developed -- only your creativity and
understanding of the tools available limit the available actions you
can present to the game player.  As with all other areas described in
these documents, each event will be presented separately and discussed
page by page, starting with Page 2.  All events have the exact same
Page 1 setup, as described below.

Using Event Variables
There are three kinds of variables: Keys, Items, and Quests.  Only
keys may be used as conditions for opening specially-locked doors, as
defined in wall placement.  Only keys and items appear in the party's
INVentory.  Any type of variable may be used as a condition for an
event (on Page 1 of the event) or as a quest.  Variables may have
values from 0 to 255; values may be altered with QUEST, SPECIAL ITEM,
and UTILITIES events.  For all variables, a value of 0 signifies that
the party does not possess the variable, while any other values
signifies that the party possesses it.  This distinction is used both
in the party's INVentory, and in the page 1 execution options of all
events.


PAGE 1 (All Events)
Page 1 of all events provides choices for execution and chaining
criteria; the format of page 1 is the same for all events.  There are
three separate choices on page 1: whether the event will only happen
once, or whether it may happen every time the party enters the
location of the event; the conditions which must be met for the event
to happen; and the conditions under which the event will chain to the
next event in sequence (these conditions do not apply to special
chains from events such as QUEST STAGE or QUESTION-YES/NO).  Note that
the "do event only once" and "event happens if" choices only determine
whether the event itself will happen, and not whether a chained event
will happen.

The "chain control" options allow you to specify whether an event will
always chain, or whether it will only chain if the event control
conditions allowed (or did not allow) the event to happen.  Note that
in an event which always goes to a special chain if the event happens,
such as an ENCOUNTER event, the normal chain may only be reached if
the event control conditions prevent the event from happening.  These
conditions may also be superseded in a QUEST STAGE event; such an
event will always chain to the standard chain if the selected quest is
not at the indicated stage.  The chain control options also allow you
to select the type of event you wish to chain to (if any) in the
standard chain.

EVENT CONTROL

* DO EVENT ONLY ONCE
If this option is selected, the event will only happen a single time
during game play, and never again.

EVENT HAPPENS IF...

[ALWAYS HAPPENS]
No criteria is applied.  If the party reaches this point in the chain,
this event will always occur.

[PARTY HAS SPECIAL ITEM]
Activates "Item/Quest" option described below. This item must be in
the party's possession in order for the event to happen.

[PARTY DOESN'T HAVE SPECIAL ITEM]
As above, except the event only happens if the party does NOT have the
item defined in Item/Quest.

[DAY TIME]
Event only occurs during daytime hours (6 AM to 8 PM).

[NIGHT TIME]
As above, but only occurs from 8 PM to 6 AM.

[RANDOM PERCENT CHANCE]
Activates the "Percent Change" option described below.  Each time this
part of the event chain is reached, a random number from 1 to 100 is
compared against the value given below.  If the random number is equal
to or below the number specified, the event occurs.

[PARTY IS SEARCHING]
Event only occurs if the party is moving with the SEARCH function
turned on.

[PARTY IS NOT SEARCHING]
As above, but party is moving without searching.

[FACING CORRECT DIRECTION]
Activates "Facing" below.  The party must be facing the indicated
direction(s) in order for this event to happen.

[QUEST COMPLETE]
Activates "Item/Quest" option.  Quests can only be set to Completed or
Failed in a Quest Stage event.

[QUEST FAILED]
As above.  However, the party must have had the quest set to "Failure"
in a Quest Stage event.

[QUEST IN PROGRESS]
A "Quest in Progress" state will be valid if the quest variable has a
non-zero value but the quest has neither been completed nor failed.

[PARTY IS DETECTING TRAPS]
Party must have a "Detect Traps" effect or spell activated for this
event to occur.

[PARTY IS NOT DETECTING TRAPS]
As above, but no "Detect Traps" effect or spell is activated.

[PARTY CAN SEE INVISIBLE]
The party must have a "See Invisible" spell or effect activated for
this event.

[PARTY CANNOT SEE INVISIBLE]
As above, no "See Invisible" active.

[SPECIFIED CLASS IS IN PARTY]
Activates "Class" option described below.  At least one character or
party NPC must be of the defined class and have an OK state in order
to trigger this event.

[SPECIFIED RACE IS IN PARTY]
Activates "Race" option described below. At least one character or
party NPC must be of the defined race and have an OK state in order to
trigger this event.

ITEM/QUEST [item 1]
Only triggered by certain qualifications above.  Selecting this pulls
up a vertical list of possible keys, items, and quests.  Only a single
selection is possible, and it should match the qualification type.

PERCENT CHANCE [1 to 99]
Only triggered by the RANDOM PERCENT CHANCE qualification.

FACING [front]
Only triggered by the FACING CORRECT DIRECTION qualification. Every
possible combination of facing choices (from 1 to 4 directions) is
selectable here.

CLASS [cleric]
Only triggered by the SPECIFIED CLASS IS IN PARTY qualification.
Select one of the six primary classes.

RACE [elf]
Only triggered by the SPECIFIED RACE IS IN PARTY qualification. Select
one of the six primary races.

CHAIN CONTROL

CHAIN [ALWAYS/IF EVENT HAPPENS/IF EVENT DOESN'T HAPPEN]
This control determines whether or not the chain of events continues
after the current event is reached.

CHAIN EVENT [NO EVENT]
The chain ends here unless another event is selected (and all
conditions are met for continuing).


ADD NPC
Allows the designer to add an NPC "monster" into the party at this
point.  If the party already has that NPC, or the party is full (8
total characters), this event is ignored and the page 1 chaining
behaves as if the condition was not met.

PAGE 2

PLAYER SEES: [vala]
Any monster art can be shown at this point.  It is not necessary to
show the player a picture of the actual NPC  about to be added.  Note
that you cannot display sprites in an overland module.

DISTANCE - [Up Close/Nearby/Far Away]
This only has an effect if the art chosen above is a sprite. In other
cases, this option is ignored.

PLAYER READS
Text shown when the picture is displayed.

ADD NPC - [vala]
Selecting this option brings up a list of only NPCs (monsters with a
"#" to the left of the name).  [NO NPC] can be selected, in which case
the player gets the message but no addition to the party.  (The same
thing can be accomplished with a TEXT event.)

WITH [1-100] % OF MAX HIT POINTS
Less than 100% indicates that the NPC is injured in some way.  Maximum
hit points are still obtainable by the player through healing of the
NPC or resting.


CAMP
This event FORCES the party into Encamp mode, but the effect is the
same as if the player had manually selected to Encamp, except that
different artwork and text may be shown.  By chaining a WHO PAYS event
to a CAMP event, you can create a simple inn.

PAGE 2

PLAYER SEES [camp 1]
Select the artwork to be displayed while the party is camping.

* BACK UP ONE STEP WHEN LEAVING
Forces the party to retreat to the location they were in previous to
the current location (after exiting Camp).

PLAYER READS
Text shown as the party encamps.


CHAIN
This event is used to branch a chain to two different sequences of
events.  If the event control conditions allow the event to happen,
the page 2 chain will be followed; otherwise, the page 1 chain will be
followed.

PAGE 2

CHAIN TO [no event]
Select an event to activate if the qualifications on Page 1 are met.


COMBAT
This is the only way to trigger combat in the game, outside of the
PICK ONE COMBAT, which is very similar.  Up to six different monster
types can be present (and up to 3 of those types can fight on the side
of the party).

PAGE 2

BEFORE COMBAT BEGINS

PLAYER SEES [no art]
ANY artwork, even the large pictures, can be shown here.

PLAYER READS
Text which appears before the combat starts.

IN COMBAT

MONSTERS ARE [UP CLOSE/NEARBY/FAR AWAY]
This determines how close initially the monsters are to the party on
the combat map.

AND [IN FRONT] OF THE PARTY
This determines the placement of the monsters on the combat map.  IN
FRONT will automatically place the monsters in the direction the party
was last facing (as if the party had literally run into them).  All
other potential direction combinations are available, for a variety of
ways to surround the party.  (For example, if you know the party is
moving East, the monsters can come in front the West as if they were
running after the party.)  Note that if impossible directions are
selected, or if there isn't enough room for all monsters to appear in
the designated locations, some monsters may not appear in the battle. 
In indoor combats, it is possible to make selections which result in
monsters appearing on the other side of walls with no access to the
party; if this happens, try adjusting the range and direction (or put
more doors in the map).

SURPRISED [NEITHER/PARTY/MONSTER]
If one of the sides is surprised, that side gets NO turns during the
first round of combat.

* AUTO APPROACH
If selected, monsters automatically run forward before combat starts
(and enter combat in UP CLOSE position, no matter where previously
set).  If a sprite is chosen for art, the monsters will be shown
racing toward the party before the battle begins.

* OUTDOORS
Forces the combat to occur outdoors, using trees, et cetera on the
combat map, instead of indoor wall art.

PAGE 3

MONSTERS ENCOUNTERED 1-3
These are always enemy monsters.  A maximum of 50 monsters total can
be in a single battle, including friendly monsters.  Note that Complex
monsters (those with a "*" to the left of their names) each count as
TWO monsters towards that maximum.

NUMBER [0 to 31]
The number of monsters of the selected type.

TYPE [goblin]
The specific monster in the encounter.  NPCs are not available for
these selections.

PAGE 4

MONSTERS ENCOUNTERED 4-6
This page acts just like the previous one (and monsters selected are
counted towards the maximum of 50). The main difference is that one or
more monsters selected can be "friendly" towards the party.  Note that
it is NOT required to have all three monster selections on Page 3
activated before choosing Monsters 4 through 6.

NUMBER [0 to 31]
As Page 3.

TYPE
As Page 3.

* FRIENDLY
If selected, monsters fight on the side of the party unless charmed.


PAGE 5

MORE COMBAT OPTIONS

* NO TREASURE FROM MONSTERS
No matter what items exist on the monster definitions, no treasure
will be gained from the monsters after this battle.  Note that if a
COMBAT TREASURE event occurs anywhere before this battle, that
treasure will still be given out.  This option ONLY affects specific
monster treasure.

* PARTY NEVER DIES
The party cannot be wiped out in this battle.  If the party loses the
battle, all characters who were conscious at the beginning of the
battle are restored to life after the battle with 1 hit point each.

* MAGIC DOESN'T WORK
No spell-casting is possible.  This includes item effects!  (The CAST
and USE functions do not appear at all in the combat menus.)

MONSTER MORALE [1 to 100]
This determines how much damage the monsters must sustain before they
flee combat or surrender, measured as a percentage of their total
starting hit points.  The higher the morale, the more damage the
monsters will take before giving up; monsters at 100 morale should
never surrender or flee.  Some slow, stupid monsters may not flee or
surrender even after their morale has been exceeded, and many powerful
monsters and types of monster such as undead have their own personal
morale, which may keep them fighting after other monsters have fled or
surrendered.

ADDITIONAL DIFFICULTY IN TURNING UNDEAD
[None/Harder/Difficult/Impossible]
This affects Clerics and Paladins using the TURN option. The number
shown is added to the number required to be "rolled" for the attempt
to succeed.  This reduction is cumulative with any additional
difficulty specified in the module's Global Information.


COMBAT TREASURE
This is treasure found above and beyond that specified by each Monster
description. (Monster treasure is always received unless the
appropriate option is selected on Page 5 of the Combat event.)  This
event should be placed immediately before the combat event.  If more
than one combat treasure event is placed before a combat event, the
party will receive the complete set of treasure.  

PAGE 2

THE PARTY FINDS
PLATINUM	[0 to 1 million]
GEMS		[0 to 50000]
JEWELRY	[0 to 100000]

THE ITEMS THEY GET
Up to 8 different items can be added to the treasure list.  Unlike the
Monster items, you cannot control the quantity of charges (wands) or
multiple items items (arrows).

* ITEMS ARE IDENTIFIED
No effect on non-magical items.  However, magical items will normally
be unidentified (e.g., a WAND OF MAGIC MISSILES would normally be
shown as WAND) unless this option is selected.

PAGE 3
Text explaining the use of a Combat Treasure Event.


DAMAGE
This event is used to inflict damage on the party outside of combat,
from traps, avalanches, or thrown boulders, for example.  A WHO TRIES
event chained to a DAMAGE event, under appropriate conditions, can be
used to represent a simple, unavoidable trap, and a QUESTION-BUTTON
event chained to a combination of events, including WHO TRIES/DAMAGE
chains, may be developed for a more complex trap.

PAGE 2

PLAYER SEES [no art]
Choose a picture, if appropriate.

[UP CLOSE/NEARBY/FAR AWAY]
Only valid for sprites.  An example of use is an event where a Goblin
shoots an arrow at the party from the end of the hall and then runs
away.  In that case, FAR AWAY would be chosen along with the GOBLIN
art.

PLAYER READS
Any text you wish displayed.

ATTACKS
Number of Complete Attacks [1 to 100]
The number of attempts made to damage the party (all attempts will be
tried, although not all may succeed).

[IS ON THE ENTIRE PARTY]
If it succeeds, the whole party takes the damage,

[IS ON THE ACTIVE CHARACTER]
Only affects the highlighted character,

[IS ON ONE PARTY MEMBER AT RANDOM]
Random choice by computer,

[HAS A PERCENT CHANCE ON EACH]
Uses the number in the next field to determine likelihood of each
individual party member being affected.

PERCENT CHANCE ON EACH [1 to 99]
Only valid if the last option is selected above.

PAGE 3

THE DAMAGE ROLL HAS [1 to 250] DICE OF [1 to 250] SIDES PLUS [0 to
250]
This could add up very quickly.  Be sure to calculate the maximum
possible damage to avoid obliterating the party (unless that is the
intention).

[NO SAVING THROW]
If the damage occurs, the full damage rolled is always taken.

[SAVE FOR HALF DAMAGE]
If the saving throw type selected below is made, only half damage is
taken.

[SAVE FOR NO DAMAGE]
As above, but no damage is taken at all.

[HITS BASED ON THAC0]
Appropriate if the party is being attacked by a weapon or object. 
This gives the better armored party members a good chance to avoid
damage.

SAVING THROW TYPE [POISON/PETRIFICATION/WAND/BREATH/SPELL]
This selects the type of saving throw to be made.  Different character
classes have differing saving throws (all of which get better at
higher levels).

ADD TO SAVING THROW [0 to 15]
The higher the number, the easier it will be for the character to make
the saving throw.

THAC0 OF ATTACK [-20 to 20]
Only valid if Hits Based on THAC0 is chosen above. This determines the
attack's ability to hit Armor Class 0, which is then modified for the
effective armor class of the character in question.


ENCOUNTER
This is not necessarily a Combat encounter (although it can lead to
one).  It can be used to trigger events based on the party's choices
as defined in the event itself.

[COMBAT, NO SURPRISE]
Trigger Combat chain (Page 2) with no surprise on either side.

[PARTY SURPRISED, IF SLOW PARTY]
Trigger Combat chain, but only if the monsters are faster than the
slowest party member.  Neither side is surprised if the party is not
SLOW.  Unconscious, poisoned, stoned, and dead party members have a
speed of 0; the speed of other party members depends upon their armor,
encumbrance, Haste spells, and Boots or Potions of Speed. 

[MONSTERS SURPRISED, IF FAST PARTY]
As above, but only if party is faster than the monsters.  Neither side
is surprised if the party is slow.

[TALK]
Triggers TALK chain from Page 2.

Up to 8 items can be selected (see Item List in Appendix A).

* ITEMS ARE IDENTIFIED
If not selected, magical items will show generic names until
identified by a shopkeeper.


GUIDED TOUR
Tours do not work in Overland modules (they require the 3-D view to be
functional).  The Guided Tour events are ONLY used for actually moving
the party around.  For more excitement, they should be chained with
SOUND and other events (including multiple Guided Tour events).

PICK ONE COMBAT
NOTE - This event is referred to in the DESIGNER'S GUIDE as a "RANDOM
COMBAT EVENT."  This event like the COMBAT event, except there are no
friendly monsters possible, and ALL monsters do not appear in each
battle.  Instead, the computer randomly picks a monster group
(numbered 1 through 6) and presents the party with only a single group
to fight.  Groups containing no monsters will not be selected.  Note
that only one sprite or picture can be shown to the player, so a more
complex event chain consisting of several different PICK ONE COMBAT
events may be necessary to present the players with a wide variety
pictures and different monster types.  Options shown below are
identical to the COMBAT event except where noted.

MONSTER MORALE [1 to 100]
The higher the morale, the more damage the monsters must take before
they attempt to flee or surrender.

ADDITIONAL DIFFICULTY IN TURNING UNDEAD [0 to 100]
Gives normal, hard, difficult, or impossible chances for Clerics and
Paladins to turn Undead.  This is in addition to the difficulty set in
the module's Global Information.

MONSTERS THAT MAY BE ENCOUNTERED (1-3 and 4-6)
These sections work just like pages 3 and 4 in the COMBAT Event
description, except Monsters 4-6 cannot be selected as FRIENDLY.


QUEST STAGE
This is the event which guides the party through the various Quests in
the game.  A Quest can only be set as COMPLETED through this Quest,
and it can only be advanced (for multi-stage Quests) through this
stage.  With up to 44 Quests in one adventure, and up to 100 stages
with each Quest, much can be done through the use of this single
event.  A QUEST STAGE event only occurs if the Quest in question (set
on Page 2) is at the previous stage marked on Page 2.  (For example,
if on Page 2 you set the Stage to 5, the Quest's current stage must be
4 in order for this event to occur.)

A simple heroic quest generally starts with an "accept on yes" QUEST
STAGE (the queen asks the party to rescue her son, who has been
kidnapped by a dragon), which may have "quest fails upon rejection"
selected (*loud belch* from under volcano); followed by one or more
"accept automatic (no question)" QUEST STAGEs associated with heroic
deeds (locating the shepherd who knows the secret path to the dragon's
lair, slaying the fearsome beast, and striking the chains from the
prince before the volcano explodes); and finally an "accept automatic
(no question)" QUEST STAGE with "quest completed upon acceptance"
selected (reuniting the tearful, happy royalty and hauling off the
loot before lava covers palace).  For a complex example of this sort
of quest, examine Yemandra's quarters at column 3, row 27 of dungeon 4
in "The Heirs to Skull Crag."  Note that quest 4 is the rescue of
Morudel, quest 5 is used to keep track of how many item quests have
been completed, and quest 10 is used to determine whether the party
may be offered another item quest at this time; the actual quest for
the Lance of the Roadwarden is quest 3.

QUESTION-BUTTON
This event provides the player with text and a horizontal list of up
to five options to select.  Each option can chain to a separate event.  
Note that each button must start with a letter unique from the first
letter of any other button.  (Note: In version 1.0 Do not use ANY
numbers, they cause the buttons to be stacked strangely.  Be sure to
use only alphabetic characters and some symbols.) The maximum number
of letters in all button labels combined must not exceed 34 characters
(including spaces in multi-word buttons).  All five buttons do not
need to be used.  Standard uses for QUESTION-BUTTON events include

SHOP
For selling (or perhaps giving) the party any of the various objects

COST FACTOR [NORMAL]
The cost, in platinum, of the items available for sale.  NORMAL does
not change the prices at all.  FREE changes all prices to 0.  Other
multipliers and dividers (from Multiple by 100 down to Divide by 100)
are available.  A full list of items with Normal prices is available
in Appendix D.

* BACKUP ONE STEP WHEN LEAVING
Returns the party to its previous location.

PICK THE FOUR TYPES OF ITEMS IN STOCK...
TYPES 1 to 4
It IS possible to select the same item group multiple times, but this

set all Types to NONE (and do not customize the default settings), a
shop with only VIEW POOL APPRAISE EXIT will appear in the game.

PAGES 3 through 6
A list of all the items in the group chosen for each TYPE appear here. 
A TYPE set to NONE shows a list of the objects from +0 WEAPONS A (with
all items unselected).  If a specific item group was chosen, all items
are initially selected (red button).  The designer can deselect any
combination of items to customize the shop.


SMALL TOWN
Use this event to provide a town's services and supplies to travellers
on the Overland maps (although it can be used in Dungeon modules as
well) without the need to build a full-blown town.  You may want to
chain a QUESTION-YES/NO event to a SMALL TOWN (via the "yes" chain) to
provide some description of the town and offer the party the choice of
whether or not to enter the town.

* TRAINING HALL
Where the party can train for higher levels, and also where character
and game functions may be used (Add/Delete character, Save/Load game,
etc.)

* SHOP
Where items may be purchased, identified, and sold.  Only two
categories of items may be sold at any SMALL TOWN shop.

* INN
Same functions available as ENCAMPING, but with no chance of
encounters.

* TAVERN
Small version of TAVERN event (no drink choices, only one tale)

* VAULT
Where characters may store items and money (the party may recover the
items and money at any vault, not just the vault where they deposited
their possessions).

TAVERN TALE
The text displayed while the party is drinking in the tavern.  Note -
If a TAVERN TALES event is placed immediately before the SMALL TOWN
event, additional Tavern Tales can be added to this text.  Tales are
shown sequentially - the Small Town Tavern Tale first, followed, in
order, by the TAVERN TALES event tales.

SHOP ITEMS...
TYPES 1 and 2
Up to two different types of items are available.  A full list of
available items is shown in Appendix A.

PAGES 5 and 6
For customization of the item choices, as described in the SHOP event.


SOUNDS
For playing up to 10 sounds and themes in a row.  Multiple sound
effects in a row can simulate distant (or nearby) battles or set the
stage for a new scenario in the game.  Only sound effects and themes
from previous Gold Box games area available -- new sounds cannot be
substituted.

PAGES 2 and 3
Select from one of the 21 sounds and themes (or NO SOUND) available
for each of SOUND slots 1 through 10.  Sounds are always played in the
order shown.


SPECIAL ITEM
Used for giving or removing a special item or key from the party. The
arithmetic effect is to assign a value of 1 to the item variable if it
is given to the party, or 0 if it is taken away.  This event only
counts as happening for page 1 chaining if the party doesn't already
have the item (for give) or already has the item (for take).

ITEM [item 1]

STAIRS
Used to let the party move to different locations within a single
module.  A STAIRS event happens as the party tries to enter the
location containing the event, so the party never actually enters the
location.  This allows you to put a STAIRS event behind a wall-set
image of a stairway and have the STAIRS event happen when the party
attempts to move across the "stairway" wall, without letting the party
see what's on the other side of the wall.  Note: ENTRY POINTS do not
work for Stairs in IBM version 1.0.

* EXECUTE EVENT AT DESTINATION
If there is an event on the new location, selecting this option will
automatically execute that event (otherwise, the event is only

TAVERN
This event is used to create a public house where the party may
socialize with the inhabitants of the local demesne (start a fight),
share tales of wondrous events (eavesdrop), and sample local
concoctions (use your imagination).  The party's options in a tavern
are indicated by buttons at the bottom of the screen.  This event can
be modified by placing a TAVERN TALES event immediately preceding it
(to add up to six more tales to those defined within).

Randomly chooses a tale (including any in a preceding TAVERNS TALES
event) to display.  Tales can be repeating without seeing the entire
list (each time TALK is selected, the entire list of possible tales is
randomly searched).

...CHAIN TO [NO EVENT]
This selection is only valid if you have at least one named drink.  It
is activated when a character gains 60 or more "consumption" point. 
(Drink points are described on this Page in the editor)  If you want a
certain event to occur after the characters have been drinking a
while, any event can be chosen for this item.

DRINK NAMES 1 to 5
A maximum of 34 characters can be used TOTAL for all drink names
(including spaces).  Each drink name itself can be up to 15 characters
(keeping the total in mind). Each drink name must start with a unique
letter.  Note that Drink Names are ignored unless ALLOW DRINKS is
activated.  (Note: In version 1.0 as with the QUESTION-BUTTONS event,
only letters should be used in drink names -- numbers cause the names
to show up strangely in the game.)


TAVERN TALES
This event ONLY has an effect on the game if a SMALL TOWN (with the
Tavern option turned on) or a TAVERN event immediately follows it. Its
purpose is to add additional tales to the Tavern.  Only one TAVERN
TALES event can be added before each of the above events.

PAGES 2 through 4
Enter the text of up to six additional Tavern Tales.

PAGE 5

TELEPORTER
This event functions in exactly the same fashion as a STAIRS event,
except that it takes place as the party moves into or LOOKs at the
location of the event, whereas a STAIRS event happens when the party
attempts to leave an adjoining location to enter the event's location;
thus, in a TELEPORTER, the party will be able see the walls of the
location containing the event from the location itself, which is not
possible in a STAIRS event.  (Note that, as with Stairs, the ENTRY
POINT method of teleport does not work properly in IBM version 1.0. 
Only coordinate points should be used for teleportation with that
version.)

UTILITIES
This event is used for arithmetic and logical operations on variables,
and for ending an adventure.  You may perform each of the three types
of operation in a single UTILITIES event, although it is rather
pointless to perform any other operations if you are ending the
adventure.

The first type of operation is arithmetic.  An arithmetic operation
allows you to add, subtract, or store a specific value in the variable
you select.  Values must be positive integers between 0 and 255. 
Remember that a value of zero indicates that the party does not
possess a given item, while any other value indicates that the party
does possess the item.

The second operation is ending the adventure, which exits play.  It is
recommended that you warn the player before ending the adventure, and
provide an opportunity to save the characters in the party, if they
are to be allowed further adventures.

The third operation is a multi-item check.  This allows you to check
whether the party has any or all of any six items and, if they do,
give them a seventh item.  If you are checking fewer than six items,
simply check one of the items several times.  This operation may be
useful for determining whether the party has completed any of several
tasks required to proceed, or whether the party has completed all of
the tasks required to proceed, as the case may be.

PAGE 2

MATH

[0 to 255]
This value is used in the below operations.

[NO OPERATION]
Value above is ignored and no special operation occurs.

Choose an Item, Key or Quest.  Once a value is stored in this
selection, the party will have that item, or be at stage 1 of the
designated Quest.


VAULT
As with the Small Town event's Vault, this is where players may store
excess money and items.  There can only be a single "real" Vault in
the game, so anything stored in one vault becomes available from any
other vault placed into the game.

WHO PAYS
This event is used to allow the player to select a party member to pay
a specified price.  If a selected party member has sufficient wealth
to pay the price, the price is deducted from the party member's
wealth, and the party has succeeded.  If the party exits without
paying, they have failed.
