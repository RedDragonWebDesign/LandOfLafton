## Introduction - Son

When I was around 7 years old, my dad spent a month or two with the office door closed for an hour or two a day working on something mysterious. During Christmas that year, I found out what it was. He had spent many many hours programming in his Dungeons & Dragons content that he had played during the 80s into the hottest new D&D software at the time: Unlimited Adventures. And he gave it to me for Christmas. I spent many hours playing this design. This ended up becoming a formative and important part of my childhood. I have many fond memories of this.

## Introduction - Father

Land of Lafton

Lafton is a small keep located in the middle of a troubled continent. Civilization is being stressed by the forces of evil. Key mountian passes are blocked by monsters, or worse yet, greedy and powerful humans. Beneath it all lies a powerful source of evil.

This Unlimited Adventures design is the electronic version of my world. My original world was started back in 1978 and I've been adding to it slowly ever since. I and others played in this world off and on from 1978 through 1994. Beginning this year, I transformed portions of it into Unlimited Adventures. My seven year old son and I have been playing and testing it ever since.

You can start out at 4th level and work yourself up. Explore Lafton, and then start traveling arround. If an area seems too hard, reduce the difficulty to Novice. If that still doesn't work, give up on that area and go elsewhere to 
get more experience, then come back later when you are stronger.

I hope you have fun.

* Join the thieves guild for 100PP. This will get you a key to an apartment so you don't need to pay the innkeeper, and will get you the correct password to the inner keep.

## List of saved games

* [TODO: add]

## Custom artwork

None that I recall. I think it's all vanilla Unlimited Adventures artwork.

## Custom monster stats

Not much modification to monster stats. Looks like around 20 have been modified. If you go into the monster editor, I see a couple out of alphabetical order (a bug?), a couple with * next to them (modified?), and a couple with (#) next to them (NPCs that were renamed?)

## Password

The password to edit the design is 3410

Fun fact: Unlimited Adventures stores its design passwords in cleartext, towards the end of the file GAME001.DAT. I discovered this as a kid and broken into Land of Lafton even though my dad was trying to keep me out of the dungeon editor. Lol.

## Bugs and corruption

This design may be slightly damaged. The following things have happened to it:

* The dungeon editor has an "off by 1" error for dungeons 25 and above. The dungeon display name doesn't match the actual dungeon name.
* Dungeon 22 is currently blank. Perhaps this used to be a dungeon and got messed up.

I recall a hard drive failure deleting some un-backed-up designs I had created, and it also probably destroyed a couple dungeons in Land of Lafton. I think we had to revert to an old backup that was missing some dungeons.

If you know how to fix any of these bugs, please feel free to make a ticket or a pull request!

## Things to fix

* I have a note that Hobgoblin Pass is buggy.
* There's a nasty battle in Drow 1 that is duplicated once at each door. Should merge those together so that PCs don't trigger it twice by mistake.

## Dungeons to add

* Dungeon 15 Ships was never finished.
* Dungeon 20 Colga Wharf was never finished. It may have been lost in a hard drive failure.
* Dungeon 22 Porttown Dungeon is blank. It may have been lost in a hard drive failure. It is basically the dungeon from TSR 2001.

## The Secret Shop

If you have PCs from other adventures and you want to import them into this design at high level, one way to do it is to create the characters at low level, then visit the secret shop. The secret shop is visited via Gorgobina. After the menu town, it will ask you where to go. Select "Stay in Gorgobina". Then it will ask you "Do you look for the secret shop?" Click "yes" and give the password "Tower". This will take you to a special shop with 7 rooms where you can buy magical items for free and gain experience points for free to equip your characters. The secret shop is technically located in Dungeon 03 Goblin Caves. I do not recommend visiting the secret shop for anything except for equipping imported characters one time, as this is basically a powerful cheat that will make the game less fun.
