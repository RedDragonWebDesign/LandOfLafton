## Introduction - Son

When I was around 7 years old, my dad spent a month or two with the office door closed for an hour or two a day working on something mysterious. During Christmas that year, I found out what it was. He had spent many many hours programming in his Dungeons & Dragons content that he had played during the 80s into the hottest new D&D software at the time: Unlimited Adventures. And he gave it to me for Christmas. I spent many hours playing this design. This ended up becoming a formative and important part of my childhood. I have many fond memories of this.

## Introduction - Father

Land of Lafton

Lafton is a small keep located in the middle of a troubled continent. Civilization is being stressed by the forces of evil. Key mountian passes are blocked by monsters, or worse yet, greedy and powerful humans. Beneath it all lies a powerful source of evil.

This Unlimited Adventures design is the electronic version of my world. My original world was started back in 1978 and I've been adding to it slowly ever since. I and others played in this world off and on from 1978 through 1994. Beginning this year, I transformed portions of it into Unlimited Adventures. My seven year old son and I have been playing and testing it ever since.

You can start out at 4th level and work yourself up. Explore Lafton, and then start traveling arround. If an area seems too hard, reduce the difficulty to Novice. If that still doesn't work, give up on that area and go elsewhere to get more experience, then come back later when you are stronger.

I hope you have fun.

## Map of overland

Coordinates such as (5,4) are the menu town's location in Dungeon 03 Transfer. Codes starting with D such as D04 stand for "Dungeon" and correspond to the module number.

## List of NPCs

NPCs don't get any money when you press share. But you also can't trade anything out of their inventory or sell from their inventory.

* Lemunda - Lafton 1. pick her up in the tavern. level 6 fighter
* Cheryl Teak
	* Lafton 2 - in a room upstairs. there's also a spot where she is removed downstairs, so avoid that spot if you want to keep her
	* Lafton 3 - picked up in Gorgobina
* Athlon
	* Drow 1 - ranger. can rescue him. he's a prisoner in the first room. he gives you the Drow Key
	* Lafton 3 - picked up in Gorgobina
* Apolla
* [TODO: more]

## Starting settings

* 8000 XP per character (4th level)
* modest starting equipment per character
* 50 platinum pieces per character

## Saved games and characters

For more details about the saved games and characters that come with this design, see [SAVED_GAMES.md](SAVED_GAMES.md).

## Custom artwork

None that I recall. I think it's all vanilla Unlimited Adventures artwork.

## Custom monster stats

Not much modification to monster stats. Looks like around 20 have been modified. If you go into the monster editor, I see a couple out of alphabetical order (a bug?), a couple with * next to them (modified?), and a couple with (#) next to them (NPCs that were renamed?)

## Password

The password to edit the design is 3410

Fun fact: Unlimited Adventures stores its design passwords in cleartext, towards the end of the file GAME001.DAT. I discovered this as a kid and broken into Land of Lafton even though my dad was trying to keep me out of the dungeon editor. Lol.

## Corruption

This design may be slightly damaged. If you know how to fix any of these bugs, please feel free to make a ticket or a pull request! The following things have happened to it:

* The dungeon editor has an "off by 1" error for dungeons 25 and above. The dungeon display name doesn't match the actual dungeon name.

## Events to fix

* Lafton 2 - remove fake door in the dungeon
* I have a note that Hobgoblin Pass is buggy.
* There's a nasty battle in Drow 1 that is duplicated once at each door. Should merge those together so that PCs don't trigger it twice by mistake.

## Dungeons to add

* Dungeon 15 Ships was never finished.
* Dungeon 20 Colga Wharf was never finished. It may have been lost in a hard drive failure.
* Dungeon 22 Porttown Dungeon is blank. It may have been lost in a hard drive failure. It is basically the dungeon from TSR 2001.
* We played TSR 9023 In Search Of The Unknown on tabletop D&D but it never got programmed into this. This is the dungeon called Quasqueton and it has an upper level and a lower level. I believe it was by the city of Dion. Definitely somewhere in the east.

## The Secret Shop

If you have PCs from other adventures and you want to import them into this design at high level, one way to do it is to create the characters at low level, then visit the secret shop. The secret shop is visited via Gorgobina. After the menu town, it will ask you where to go. Select "Stay in Gorgobina". Then it will ask you "Do you look for the secret shop?" Click "yes" and give the password "Tower". This will take you to a special shop with 7 rooms where you can buy magical items for free and gain experience points for free to equip your characters. The secret shop is technically located in Dungeon 03 Goblin Caves. I do not recommend visiting the secret shop for anything except for equipping imported characters one time, as this is basically a powerful cheat that will make the game less fun.

## Things to do on day 1

* go to the inn, memorize spells, and rest
* change game speed to 0 (fastest)
* change game difficulty to Veteran (in the middle, no XP penalties or bonuses, no modifications to monster difficulty)
* your characters come equipped with melee weapons and armor. but you'll want to buy some other stuff:
	* buy composite long bow and arrows for your fighter, paladin, ranger
	* buy composite short bow for your thief
	* buy a staff sling for your clerice
	* bows and arrows for everyone but your magic users
	* quarterstaffs and extra darts for your magic users
* Join the Guild of Heroes for 100PP. This will get you a key to an apartment so you don't need to pay the innkeeper, and will get you the correct password to the inner keep.
* Visit the tavern to pick up an NPC (Lemunda) and to get a quest to kill some thieves.

## Tips

* use "Q" to put any character on autopilot. best avoided with magic users since you want to micromanage what spells they cast. press "spacebar" during any character's turn to turn off all the quick modes you turned on.
* any character that goes unconscious, stand next to them with another character and press "B" to bandage them. this will save you an expensive trip to the temple to "raise dead" (which also permanently subtracts a point of constitution).
* have someone keep "detect magic" memorized all the time. then cast it on loot screens to see which items are magical. your first magical items in Lafton 1 will be in the first thieves' battle. if you have multiple combats in a row, the detect magic will last awhile.
* Lafton has the cheapest training. About 500 PP.
* Give magic bracers to your magic users. They don't improve your armor class, they just set your armor class. So your other characters that can wear armor will already have AC better than your bracers.
* If your characters die, go back to a saved game. Otherwise you have to go find a temple with at least level 5 spells to do raise dead, which is expensive, and which permanently drains a constitution point.
* If your characters get drained a level by undead, go back to a saved game. Otherwise you have to go find a temple with at least level 7 spells to do restoration, which is expensive.
* Unconscious characters miss out on experience points. Cast "cure light wounds" on them before the battle ends to get them back up.
* Spiders and some other creatures that poison you don't instantly kill you even though it looks like it. You can cast the 4th level cleric spell "neutralize poison" (or visit a temple and have them cast it), and the poisoned person will get right up and have 1 HP.
* You should keep "search" on all the time, unless it is causing lots of random encounters. Search lets you find most secret doors and some events that are "search only".
* Versus creatures with really nasty magical abilities, such as dragons and beholders, have them opportunity attack you to get them to waste their ability for that turn.
