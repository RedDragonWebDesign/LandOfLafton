## Introduction - Son

When I was around 7 years old, my dad spent a month or two with the office door closed for an hour or two a day working on something mysterious. During Christmas that year, I found out what it was. He had spent many many hours programming in his Dungeons & Dragons content that he had played during the 80s into the hottest new D&D software at the time: Unlimited Adventures. And he gave it to me for Christmas. I spent many hours playing this design. This ended up becoming a formative and important part of my childhood. I have many fond memories of this.

## Introduction - Father

Land of Lafton

Lafton is a small keep located in the middle of a troubled continent. Civilization is being stressed by the forces of evil. Key mountian passes are blocked by monsters, or worse yet, greedy and powerful humans. Beneath it all lies a powerful source of evil.

This Unlimited Adventures design is the electronic version of my world. My original world was started back in 1978 and I've been adding to it slowly ever since. I and others played in this world off and on from 1978 through 1994. Beginning this year, I transformed portions of it into Unlimited Adventures. My seven year old son and I have been playing and testing it ever since.

You can start out at 4th level and work yourself up. Explore Lafton, and then start traveling arround. If an area seems too hard, reduce the difficulty to Novice. If that still doesn't work, give up on that area and go elsewhere to get more experience, then come back later when you are stronger.

I hope you have fun.

	* add - Lafton 2 level 4
	* remove Lafton 2 level 1, when entering the main door (facing west)

## Starting settings

* 8000 XP per character (4th level)
* modest starting equipment per character
* 50 platinum pieces per character

## Saved games and characters

For more details about the saved games and characters that come with this design, see [SAVED_GAMES.md](SAVED_GAMES.md).

## Custom artwork

None that I recall. I think it's all vanilla Unlimited Adventures artwork.

## Custom monster stats

Not much modification to monster stats. Looks like around 20 have been modified. If you go into the monster editor, I see a couple out of alphabetical order (a bug?), a couple with * next to them (modified?), and a couple with (#) next to them (NPCs that were renamed?)

## Corruption

This design may be slightly damaged. If you know how to fix any of these bugs, please feel free to make a ticket or a pull request! The following things have happened to it:

* The dungeon editor has an "off by 1" error for dungeons 25 and above. The dungeon display name doesn't match the actual dungeon name.

## Events and walls to fix

* Lafton 1 - The front gate doesn't have a backside. Should add it.
* Goblin caves - redo the witch's lair (which is what it's called in the menus) to be a witch's lair, not a minotaur lair. in addition, add magic mouths. in addition, look at my old D&D binder to see old map of it and other notes. in addition, change the random encounters in that zone to not be minotaurs.
* Goblin caves - has too many random encounters. reduce their frequency by like 50%. this includes both the west half (non goblins) and the east half (goblins).
* Pass - I have a note that Hobgoblin Pass is buggy.
* Drow 1 - There's a nasty battle that is duplicated once at each door. Should merge those together so that PCs don't trigger it twice by mistake.
* Transfer - Gobville's and Gorbobina's shops has a bunch of expensive and weird magic items instead of regular items

## Dungeons to add

* Dungeon 15 Ships was never finished.
* Dungeon 20 Colga Wharf was never finished. It may have been lost in a hard drive failure.
* Dungeon 22 Porttown Dungeon is blank. It may have been lost in a hard drive failure. It is basically the dungeon from TSR 2001.
* We played TSR 9023 In Search Of The Unknown on tabletop D&D but it never got programmed into this. This is the dungeon called Quasqueton and it has an upper level and a lower level. I believe it was by the city of Dion. Definitely somewhere in the east.

## The Secret Shop

If you have PCs from other adventures and you want to import them into this design at high level, one way to do it is to create the characters at low level, then visit the secret shop. The secret shop is visited via Gorgobina. After the menu town, it will ask you where to go. Select "Stay in Gorgobina". Then it will ask you "Do you look for the secret shop?" Click "yes" and give the password "Tower". This will take you to a special shop with 7 rooms where you can buy magical items for free and gain experience points for free to equip your characters. The secret shop is technically located in Dungeon 03 Goblin Caves. I do not recommend visiting the secret shop for anything except for equipping imported characters one time, as this is basically a powerful cheat that will make the game less fun.

## Things to do on day 1

* go to the inn, memorize spells, and rest
* change game speed to 0 (fastest)
* change game difficulty to Veteran (in the middle, no XP penalties or bonuses, no modifications to monster difficulty)
* your characters come equipped with melee weapons and armor. but you'll want to buy some other stuff:
	* buy composite long bow and arrows for your fighter, paladin, ranger
	* buy composite short bow for your thief
	* buy a staff sling for your clerice
	* composite long bows and 200 arrows for your fighters, paladins, and rangers
	* composite short bows and 200 arrows for your thieves
	* quarterstaffs and darts for your magic users. the darts aren't really worth it when you're doing manual combat (they miss a lot and only do 1d3 damage), but are good for when you quick combat them
	* buy everyone a mirror. cheap and good for use vs medusas
	* buy plate mail for your fighters, paladins, rangers, and clerics. buy leather armor for your thief. can't buy any armor for magic users.
* Join the Guild of Heroes for 100PP. This will get you a key to an apartment so you don't need to pay the innkeeper, and will get you the correct password to the inner keep.
* Visit the tavern to pick up an NPC (Lemunda) and to get a quest to kill some thieves.

## Tips

* use "Q" to put any character on autopilot. best avoided with magic users since you want to micromanage what spells they cast. press "spacebar" during any character's turn to turn off all the quick modes you turned on.
* if any character that goes unconscious, use another character (standing anywhere) and press "B" to bandage them. this will save you an expensive trip to the temple to "raise dead" (which also permanently subtracts a point of constitution and sometimes doesn't work).
* have someone keep "detect magic" memorized all the time. then cast it on loot screens to see which items are magical. your first magical items in Lafton 1 will be in the first thieves' battle. if you have multiple combats in a row, the detect magic will last awhile.
* Lafton has the cheapest training. About 500 PP. [TODO: double check]
* Give magic bracers to your magic users. They don't improve your armor class, they just set your armor class. So your other characters that can wear armor will already have AC better than your bracers.
* If your characters die, go back to a saved game. Otherwise you have to go find a temple with at least level 5 spells to do raise dead, which is expensive, and which permanently drains a constitution point.
* If your characters get drained a level by undead, go back to a saved game. Otherwise you have to go find a temple with at least level 7 spells to do restoration, which is expensive.
* Unconscious characters miss out on experience points. Cast "cure light wounds" on them before the battle ends to get them back up.
* Spiders and some other creatures that poison you don't instantly kill you even though it looks like it. You can cast the 4th level cleric spell "neutralize poison" (or visit a temple and have them cast it for about 100 PP), and the poisoned person will get right up and have 1 HP.
* You should keep "search" on all the time, unless it is causing lots of random encounters. Search lets you find most secret doors and some events and treasure that are "search only".
* Versus creatures with really nasty magical abilities, such as dragons and beholders, have them opportunity attack you (move adjacent to them then away from them) to get them to waste their ability for that turn.
* Your party order (changeable in Encamp -> Alt -> Order) determines who is in your front row and who is in your back row in battle. Counter-intuitively, the #4 spot is oftentimes the farthest forward, so don't put a non-fighter/paladin/ranger there.
* Drow elves are pretty tough opponents. They are resistant to magic and carry magic equipment. Sadly, their magic equipment is not very useful though -- it disintegrates as soon as you go to a dungeon with sunlight. [TODO: double check]
* Prioritize attacking high level mages, even if they're standing in the back. Fireballs and lightning bolts hurt a lot of people. Hold person or silence can be good to get them to stop casting spells. So can doing damage to them each turn (in AD&D, if you damage a spellcaster, they can't cast that turn).
* The third level magic user and cleric spell "dispel magic" is great for getting rid of the effects of enemy spellcasters. For example, it will break hold person, silence, etc.
* Everyone should carry a mirror. Ready it in place of your shield when you encounter medusas.
* When you're fighting a tough combat, try using a mage scroll to cast hold monster (5th level magic user spell). This lets you try to hold up to 4 monsters. Usually you'll get 2-3 of them. They'll be frozen and susceptible to one shot kills. You can find mage scrolls in various places, for example in the mage's room on level 5 of the keep in Lafton 2.
* Cast cleric buffs (prayer, bless) BEFORE battle. If you cast it during, it'll only affect a few people instead of the entire party.
