[![ReddRagonWebDesign's characters](characters_reddragonwebdesign.png)](characters_reddragonwebdesign.png)

Manwell was created during tabletop D&D and was my main character. Mavid was created during tabletop D&D, when playing a bible/Jesus-themed world. Mavid's name was probably part of my dad's funny tradition of taking famous people and changing their first name to M, such as Manta Claus and Mesus.

* A - RedDragonWebDesign's characters, low level. According to saved game last modified dates, this was used in a 2015 replay. Perhaps I added characters from the "add character" screen, which is how I was able to get these 1990s characters at a low level.
